# We need maintainers!
I have less time to maintain this project :(      
# What's this?
Currently aarch64 only, all-in-one pack of rurima binary and its dependencies.        
# Warning:
Only use this for fully restricted environment, like magisk module.           
Might not work in termux without root. For termux user, you can use `pkg in file curl jq proot tar xz-utils wget gzip coreutils` to install dependencies, and use original rurima binary.             
# Notes:
Some commands, including `rurima`, `file`, `curl`, are just wrappers of the real binaries.
